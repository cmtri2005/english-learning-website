## Introduction

Even advanced English learners make common grammar mistakes. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the **10 most frequent errors** and how to avoid them.



## 1. Subject-Verb Agreement

One of the most common mistakes is failing to match subjects with their verbs.

### Example
> ❌ **Incorrect:** “The team are playing”  
> ✅ **Correct (American English):** “The team is playing”

**Tip:** Collective nouns (team, family, staff) are often treated as **singular** in American English.



## 2. Misusing Articles

Knowing when to use **“a,” “an,”** or **“the”** can be tricky.

### Rule of thumb
- Use **a** before **consonant sounds**
- Use **an** before **vowel sounds**

> ✅ **Remember:** It’s about the **sound**, not the letter.  
> Example: **an** hour (silent “h”), **a** university (“you” sound).



## 3. Confusing *Its* and *It’s*

Many learners mix these up, but the rule is simple:

- **its** = possessive (belongs to it)  
- **it’s** = **it is**

### Mini check
> If you can replace the word with **“it is”**, use **it’s**. Otherwise, use **its**.
