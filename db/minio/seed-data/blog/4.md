## 1. Listen and Repeat

Use podcasts, audiobooks, and videos. Listen to native speakers and repeat what they say, mimicking their **intonation** and **rhythm**.

**Try this:**  
- Listen to 1–2 sentences  
- Pause  
- Repeat with the same speed and melody



## 2. Record Yourself

Recording your voice helps you identify areas for improvement. Compare your pronunciation with native speakers.

**Tip:** Focus on one thing at a time (ending sounds, stress, or intonation), not everything at once.



## 3. Focus on Phonemes

English has **44 phonemes** (distinct sounds). Practice the sounds that don't exist in your native language.

> ✅ Choose 2–3 difficult sounds and drill them daily (5 minutes).



## 4. Learn Word Stress Patterns

English is a **stress-timed** language. Understanding where to stress syllables is crucial for natural-sounding speech.

**Example idea:**  
- Record “PRE-sent” (noun) vs “pre-SENT” (verb) and compare.



## 5. Practice Tongue Twisters

Tongue twisters are excellent for improving articulation and muscle memory.

**How to practice:**  
- Start slow → increase speed  
- Stay clear, not just fast



## Mini Routine (10 minutes/day)

- **3 min:** Listen & repeat  
- **3 min:** Phoneme drills  
- **2 min:** Stress practice
