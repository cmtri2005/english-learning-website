## Understanding the Task

IELTS Writing Task 2 requires you to write an essay of at least **250 words** in response to a **point of view, argument, or problem**.

**Time limit:** **40 minutes**

> ✅ **Goal:** Answer the question directly, develop ideas clearly, and support them with relevant explanations/examples.



## Essay Structure

A strong Task 2 essay usually follows this simple 4-part structure:

1. **Introduction** — Paraphrase the question and state your position  
2. **Body Paragraph 1** — First main idea with supporting details  
3. **Body Paragraph 2** — Second main idea with supporting details  
4. **Conclusion** — Summarize main points and restate your position  

### Quick tip
> Keep body paragraphs balanced: one clear main idea + explanation + example.



## Key Assessment Criteria

IELTS examiners score your essay using these four criteria:

- **Task Response** — Answer all parts of the question  
- **Coherence and Cohesion** — Logical organization and linking  
- **Lexical Resource** — Vocabulary range and accuracy  
- **Grammatical Range and Accuracy** — Sentence structures and grammar
