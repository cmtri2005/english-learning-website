## Common Uses

### After verbs like *suggest, recommend, insist, demand...*

In this pattern, English often uses the **base form** of the verb (no **-s**, no tense change), especially in American English:

**Structure:**  
> **Verb + (that) + subject + base verb**

**Examples**
- “I **suggest (that) he study** more.” ✅  
- “They **insisted (that) she be** present.” ✅  
- “The manager **demanded (that) everyone arrive** on time.” ✅  

**Common mistake**
- ❌ “I suggest that he **studies** more.”  
- ✅ “I suggest that he **study** more.”

**Note (British English):** BrE often allows alternatives like **should**:  
- “I suggest that he **should study** more.” ✅
